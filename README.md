## 📰 Introduction
This mod is designed to fix various memory leaks from mods, Minecraft and (Neo)Forge.

Many players suffer from playing their modded modpacks and eventually needing to close the game or crash after some time.
This is a classic symptom of memory leak.

Our goal is to make it as much stable as possible.

## 🗳️ Motivation
To fill the gap between the fast pace of some modpack development and mod fixes, specially for deprecated Minecraft versions.
When the original mod implement their fixes, we disable ours.

## 📦 Installation

Mod is available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/altheleaks).

## 🔧 Usage

After installation, the mod will automatically apply the memory fixes that are needed.

## 🤔 FAQ
- *Will it increase my FPS?*
  If you have plenty of memory, probably not.
  But will certainly help stability, and for people with mid to low memory it will help a ton.
  *Stability, meaning it will be as smooth as you just logged in through your entire gaming session.*
- *Does it run on server?*
  Yes. There are some fixes that are common for server and clients.
- *I am using this mod, but I am still having instability over time!*
  I'm developing a tool and guide to make it easier for players to detect leaks.

## 🤝 Contributing

A guide on how to contribute with identifying memory leaks will be available soon.
